                These reports compares the maximum recorded metrics for each protocol supported by the Software Under
                Test (SUT). This comparison is made regardless of the system/test configuration as it assumes that the
                configuration variations for the SUT and the test conditions are limited.

                This report compares the SUT performance against multiple different configurations and parameters of the
                same SUT version. It is a super set of all other reports available and can be used to find, for example,
                what configuration is mostly affected by an specific set of test parameters or conditions (ie.: what
                configuration is most affected by a given patch or OS version). Because the data set can be very large,
                the reports are available as CSV files that can be downloaded an imported into Libre Office or any other
                spreadsheet sheet software.
                <p></p>
                The reports are composed of 2 data sets:
                <li>The Left Hand Side (LHS) fields contains the baseline configuration/parameters.</li>
                <li>The Right Hand Side (RHS) fields contains the configuration/parameters you want to compare with.</li>
                <p></p>
                Each data set contains the following fields:
                <li>test_id: test id.</li>
                <li>sut_id: sut id.</li>
                <li>sut_tags: sut tags are used to tag a SUT with details related to its base configuration (ie.: AIO or NIO journal).</li>
                <li>test_tags: test tags are used to tag a test with test-specific details (ie.: whether spectre patches were present, RHEL version, etc etc).</li>
                <li>sut_name: SUT name.</li>
                <li>sut_version: SUT version.</li>
                <li>test_valid: whether the test was not invalidated by errors, SUT bugs or other problems. This should almost always be true.</li>
                <li>env_resource_role: whether the data is for a sender or receiver</li>
                <li>connection_count: connection count on the node.</li>
                <li>limit_destinations: the number of destinations used in the test.</li>
                <li>message_size: the message size in bytes.</li>
                <li>messaging_protocol: the messaging protocol.</li>
                <li>variable_size: whether size variability was applied to the messages.</li>
                <li>test_rate_geometric_mean: rate geometric mean.</li>
                <li>test_date: test date.</li>
                <p></p>
                The performance difference between configurations is available on the <strong>diff</strong> field which
                contains the performance delta between the LHS and RHS data sets.
